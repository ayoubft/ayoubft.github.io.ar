In this paper, we present an approach based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Hierarchical Process Analysis (HPA) to select the optimal design for a High Speed Train (HSR) line that will relay between Casablanca and Marrakech. Such a design will serve to meet the requirements of construction cost and sustainability. The criteria that were considered in this study are: slope, land use, geology and proximity to lakes, rivers and roads. The cost estimate was calculated based on the value of land acquisition, building materials and construction costs. The results of this work show the potential of using GIS for decision making based on multi-criteria analysis, including the AHP method.
